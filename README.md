# Habit-application

This application is a Demo application for a future YouTube channel mainly focused on DevOps principles.
YouTube channel will have Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube, Openshift and much more content. 

Here is a [link](https://habit-application.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1) of the Jira Kanban Board.

This is a bird's eye view of what is to be done. Nothing concrete for the moment.
